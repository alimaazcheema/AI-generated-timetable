Timetable scheduling problem is a classical problem in the university environment where a
timetable is to be made individually for each semester ensuring minimum number of clashes
between sections, professors, and rooms. Thus, we have a timetabling problem where time slots
are assigned to each section in a particular room to be taught by a particular professor to teach
a particular course.
